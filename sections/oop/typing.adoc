== Java

* Abstract class => Inheritance

[source,java,attributes]
----
public abstract class Notifier {
    abstract void notify(Event event);
}

public class EmailNotifier extends Notifier {
    void notify(Event event) {
        ...
    }
}
----


* Interface => Formal contract

[source,java,attributes]
----
public interface Notifier {
    void notify(Event event);
}

public class EmailNotifier implements Notifier {
    void notify(Event event) {
        ...
    }
}

== Python


[NOTE.notes]
--
We choose python because it's a pretty popular language in our community now.
But python has weakness for contract and typing. It doesn't enforce type checking by runtime, making ot very flexible, maybe too much flexible.
