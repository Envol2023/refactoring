== What Do We Do When Developing Software?


We turn _human_ [.huge]#ideas#  into _computer_ [.huge]#code#




== Refactoring

Definition by https://martinfowler.com/[Martin Fowler]

* Refactoring (noun): 
** a change made to the *internal* structure of software 
** to make it easier to understand 
** and cheaper to modify 
** _without changing its observable behavior._
[%step]
--
* Refactoring (verb): 
** to restructure software 
** by applying a series of refactorings 
** _without changing its observable behavior._
--

[NOTE.notes]
--
Refactoring is the process of restructuring code, while not changing its original functionality. The goal of refactoring is to improve internal code by making many small changes without altering the code's external behavior.

* Key concepts
** _Internal changes_
*** => Developer concern
** _Same External Behavior_
*** => Not a User concern
**** User don't know refactoring occurred
* But it consumes resources
** => Project Management concern
*** Product Owner must understand refactoring benefits

[NOTE.notes]

The refactoring is a pure technical concern, user don't know about it, it don't suffer it, and that's the sign the refactoring succeeded... from the user point of view.

At the controversy, the refactoring may consumes a lot of refactoring, and some project manager are reluctant.

== Why to refactor ?

* Refactoring improves 
** Human Understanding of code
** The Software Design
*** => Better Testability
*** => Facilitate Evolution of new features
** Make more easy bug fixing
* Refactoring is a Technical Debt Management
** _Refactoring early fixes infringements of the good practices_ + 
_that will be required to fix later... or never_

== Refactoring and Agility

--
[%step]
It's *possible* to _refactor your code_ without _being agile_
[%step]
But
[%step]
It's *impossible* _to be agile_ without _refactoring your code_
--

=== Refactoring and Agility

* Continuous delivery of valuable computer software
** Delivers small increments of functionalities
*** => Software Design extensions
** Welcome changement and evolution, event late
*** => Software Design disturbances
* Technical excellence and attention to design
** => Genuine focus on Software Design
** => *Testing* is a first-class citizen activity

[.huge]#Without refactoring, agility is impossible#

4 values

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

_That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more._


. Our highest priority is to satisfy the client through early and continuous delivery of valuable computer software.
. Welcome dynamical necessities, even late in development. Agile processes harness modification for the customer’s competitive advantage.
. Deliver operating computer software often, from a pair of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
. Business individuals and developers should work along daily throughout the project.
. The build comes around actuated people. offer them the setting and support they have, and trust them to urge the task done.
. the foremost economical and effective methodology of conveyancing info to and among a development team is face-to-face speech.
. working computer software is the primary live of progress.
. Agile processes promote property development. The sponsors, developers, and users got to be able to maintain a relentless pace indefinitely.
. Continuous attention to technical excellence and smart style enhances nimbleness.
. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the number of work not done—is essential.
. the most effective architectures, necessities, and styles emerge from self– organizing groups.
. At regular intervals, the team reflects on a way to become simpler, then tunes and adjusts its behavior consequently.

== Refactoring and So What...

Refactoring is a collection of techniques and habits

You're probably doing refactoring everyday without knowing it...

== Formalization of refactoring techniques

* Martin Fowler listed around 70 techniques in a famous book

Martin Fowler has publish several editions of his famous book, from a C/C++/Java background to a Ruby then Javascript point of view.

=== Refactoring Techniques

Techniques are divided into 6 categories

** But take a look later please...

== Another way to talk about Refactoring

[.left-column]
-- 
* A high-level viewpoint rather than a catalog of techniques
** Software design and coding beacon 
* For the developer 
** Don't focus on coding
** Build a refactoring culture
* For the project manager 
** Guidance for software design
** Understand that refactoring is not a cost but an investment

[.right-column]
[%step]
--
* My reading of refactoring
** From a cognitive angle
** From the complexity management angle
** From the testability

The way I propose you to follow it is to study refactoring, not as a bunch of techniques you will forget as soon you quit this formation, but in the light of of strong principles and precepts qui constitue notre activité.

Cette façon d'approcher les problèmes s'adressent autant aux développeurs, qui parfois ont besoin de lever le nez de leur, et aux chefs de projets, qui ainsi auraient matière à orienter les choix d'orientation de conception.

Même si il est possible que des éléments paraissent parfois évident à certain, et je m'en excuse à l'avance, je souhaiterai que nous puissions faire un pas de côté et jeter un regard sur notre métier que les délais et le quotidien nous font parfois oublier.


Ma lecture, peut-être très personnelle, est de considérer le refactoring 
* Sous l'angle cognitif
* De la gestion de la complexité
* De la testabilité
