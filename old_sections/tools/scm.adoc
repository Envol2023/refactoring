== Use a Source Control Management (scm)

* Source Control Management is a **requirement**
** https://git-scm.com/[Git], https://www.mercurial-scm.org/[Mercurial] or https://subversion.apache.org/[Subversion] (disused)
* => Freedom of mind to refactor
*** Don't work with the fear of not being able to go back
* Separate refactoring from validated code.
** Use a dedicated _branch_ for refactoring
** _Never work on production server_
* Use a workflow and stick to it
** See comparison of https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/[Git workflows]
** Opinionated choice : https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/[_git-flow_] icon:star[] icon:star[] icon:star[]
* Use an on-premise or hosted but **secure**
** => Continuous Integration and Ticket Tracking System



[NOTE.notes]
--
Never work on safed code. You have to be creative and volunteer to feel comfortable.
Of course, never work on production server: refactoring is not a hotfix.
For example, don't modify live PHP code from your lab internet site just for a refactoring !

There's several SCM. GIt is now the new kind of standard, famous through gitlab and github. Mercurial is a nice alternative.
Subversion is now fallen in disuse. Switch to git or mercurial as soon as possible.

Use a dedicated branch for any new refactoring. Associate refactored code and updated tests before merging into the main branch.
